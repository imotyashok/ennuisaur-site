            appreciation for writing and literature. Poetry is my favorite way to practice the art of bending language to my will, 
            an art that I am very much a beginner at)</span> <br>

          <h1> >> Who are you? </h1> 
          <span> I'm not sure why I feel a bit embarrassed to be talking about myself - perhaps it is because it makes me confront the fact that I do in fact 
            take up a physical form (gross) - so instead here is a list of facts about me:</span> <br>
          <span>> Online, I prefer to be called Ennuisaur (she/her)</span> <br>
          <span>> I was born in Ukraine and moved to the United States when I was 6. I suffer from Immigrant Kid Syndrome to this day, 
            which is a topic I want to explore more through my art and poetry </span> <br>
          <span>> I struggle a lot with understanding my place in this world and with understanding myself, but I do know one thing - at my core, I am a creator. 
            Not a content creator in the modern day sense, but someone who is driven by the need to create for its own sake</span> <br>
          <span>> I love animals of all kinds, and I've developed a special fondness for reptiles over the years. They're so underappreciated! </span> <br>
          <span>> I have 5 pets: a Western Hognose snake, two ball pythons, a blue tongue skink, and a gargoyle gecko. Check out the "Reptiles" page to learn more about them!</span> <br>
          <span>> I like coding and programming, and one of my long term goals is to make a lil video game </span>

          <h1> >> So, what actually is an "ennuisaur"?</h1>
          <span>An ennuisaur is a creature characterized by its wide, flat head, weary eyes, moose-like horns, and short, stubby legs. It also sports a long, 
            flat blue tongue (can you guess what my inspiration for this creature was?), which allows it to sense things beyond what humans and most other animals can. 
            It can have either scales or very short fur, and indeed, there are many different varieties of ennuisaurs. Some have feathery wings, some have leathery wings, 
            some have very long torsos, some have long pointy ears, but they all have their characteristic stubby legs, colorful tongues, and jaded-looking, knowing eyes.</span>
